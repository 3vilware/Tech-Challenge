### Create an API REST for CRUD in a new e-commerce

- Create product 
- Update product price and description
- Get products (by name & by id)
- Delete products
- Make a purchase for a product (reduce stock and creates a purchase log)
- Get purchase Log


To finish the test you must deploy your API on any service you want to use (Heroku, DigitalOcean, GitHub, AWS, etc). Feel free to use your custom way if needed. 

Also, feel free to use any stack you want to complete the challenge.
You must:

- Create a database 
- Create a backed with multilple endpoints 
- Deploy your backend ðŸš€
- Provide a way to test and run your app step by step (maybe github, or any kind of documentation)

An example of this may be found on https://github.com/3vilware/E-commerce-API feel free to use as a reference if wished (it is not
required to be the same, is just a little way to solve it and it is not exactly the same challenge). 


we wish you the best you can do it! :)
